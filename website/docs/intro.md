Reply with Attachments automatically includes the original email’s attachments when you reply in Thunderbird.

Highlights:

- Automatic or confirm‑first behavior (configurable)
- De‑duplicates by filename; respects existing attachments
- Skips SMIME artifacts and inline images
- Filename blacklist with glob patterns (e.g., `*.png`, `smime.*`, `*.p7s`)

Use the sidebar to navigate Install, Options, Permissions and Changelog.
