Reply with Attachments does not collect analytics or telemetry and does not send your data anywhere.

What the add‑on does:

- Reads attachment metadata and files from the original message locally (Thunderbird API) to attach them to your reply.
- Stores your options (blacklist, confirmation, default answer) in Thunderbird’s local storage.

What the add‑on does not do:

- No tracking, analytics, crash reporting, or remote logging.
- No background network requests, except when you explicitly open external links (Docs, GitHub, Donate).

Permissions are documented on the [Permissions](permissions) page.
