1. Install the add‑on from Thunderbird Add‑ons.
2. Optional: Enable confirmation (Options → “Ask before adding attachments”).
3. Optional: Leave the blacklist warning enabled (default): “Warn if attachments are excluded by blacklist”.
4. Optional: Add blacklist patterns (one per line), e.g.:

```
*.png
smime.*
*.p7s
```

Now reply to a message with attachments — originals will be added automatically or after a quick confirmation. If any files are excluded by your blacklist, you’ll see a short warning listing them.
