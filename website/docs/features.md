## Features

- Automatically attaches files from the original email when replying.
- Configurable behavior: attachments can be
  - added automatically, or
  - added only after confirmation (a small, accessible dialog). In Options you
    can enable the confirmation and choose the default answer (Yes/No).
- Blacklist of filenames (glob patterns) prevents specific files from being
  attached automatically. Examples: `*.png`, `smime.*`, `*.p7s`.
  Matching is caseâ€‘insensitive and checks the filename only; provide one pattern
  per line in Options.
- Adds originals even if you already attached something yourself; avoids duplicates by filename.
- Skips SMIME certificates and inline images to avoid unnecessary attachments.
