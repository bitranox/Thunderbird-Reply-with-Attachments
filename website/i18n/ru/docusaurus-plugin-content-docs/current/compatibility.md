## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

- If the add-on does not work as expected, ensure that you are using a compatible version of Thunderbird (128 ESR or later).
- Check the Thunderbird error console (**Tools > Developer Tools > Error Console**) for any issues related to the add-on.
- If stored settings appear not to apply properly, restart Thunderbird and try again. (Thunderbird may cache state across sessions; a restart ensures fresh settings are loaded.)

- None known at this time. If you see repeated duplicate attachments or failures with other add‑ons, please report with steps to reproduce.

## Beta/Nightly {#beta-nightly}

- Hit a regression on Beta/Nightly? Please report it with steps to reproduce — see [Support](support) — and include the exact Thunderbird build string.
