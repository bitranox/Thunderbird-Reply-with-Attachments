# Changelog

## [2.3.0] - 2025-10-20

- Coverage: Added background logger resilience tests and expanded DOM fallback checks, lifting overall statement coverage above 94%.

## [2.2.0] - 2025-09-24

- Options: Added an "Enable debug logging" toggle under Advanced, including translations across all languages.
